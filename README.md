# Police Shootings
This is an exploratory analysis using fatal police shooting data from 2015-2021.

In 2012, 17 year old Trayvon Martin was murdered by an armed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. Trayvon was staying with relatives in the community; he was mudered roughly 70 yards away from his relatives home. Trayvon was unarmed and shot in the back. After the acqquital of George Zimmerman the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was trending on Twitter. 

In response to the 2014 of 18 year old Michael Brown, The Washington Post started documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.
